# MVA Project - Spring semester 2022

## Alexandra Pritoula, Alice Scatollin and Pablo Cabra

This is the semester project for Multivariate Analysis course from the Master in Statistics at University of Geneva, at GSEM.
We were asked to summarize in our own words the seminal paper of Generative Adversarial Networks by Ian J. Goodfellow et al. In addition we implement the algorithm that is proposed in the paper in two different datasets: MINST and FashionMNIST. We used Tensorflow library to do so.
